abstract: In the era of big data, distributed cloud storage platforms are widely used to store massive amounts of data and information. Compared with traditional storage methods, distributed cloud storage platforms can provide flexible storage space to ensure the security and speed of platform operating data. This article uses computer network technology to design a distributed cloud storage platform, test platform file upload and download time and user login platform success rate to verify the reliability of platform operation, and realize the feasibility of user login function module operation, I hope this article distributed cloud storage platform can help people process data efficiently and realize the safe preservation of data and information.
