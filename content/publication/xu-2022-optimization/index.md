abstract: The hybrid photovoltaic/battery energy storage system is a relevant pathway to generate low-cost green electricity. In the literature, cost optimization of these systems has been extensively used. However, the unpredictability of model and optimization methods input information, present the most drawbacks of optimal sizing of the system. Herein, an optimal sizing and evaluation framework are presented for an off-grid clean microgrid system solar/battery energy storage, to generate low-cost green electricity of rural building in China. The optimal sizing of the system is based on the hourly meteorological data and load demand during a year; with the lowest total life cycle cost as the objective function and the maximum reliability. A novel meta-heuristic tabu search algorithm is used in the solution process to obtain the optimal sizing of the system in terms of economics and reliability. Additionally, the variations of the optimal sizing of the system on the basis of different types of reliability index and tabu search parameters, such as initial solutions, neighborhood structure, number of run and iteration, is further comprehensively evaluated and investigated. The results prove that it is easier to find the optimal decision variables for the clean microgrid system with the optimal parameters of the algorithm.
