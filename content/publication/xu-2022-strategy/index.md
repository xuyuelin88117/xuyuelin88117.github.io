abstruct: For more efficient training, it is of great significance to know the position-power relationship of riders of different types and genders on different venues for guiding riders’ training. A number of previous studies have used pacing strategies to examine the impact of different venues on rider decision-making. Firstly, according to the test data of different athletes, the OmPD model is used to establish the rider’s own power profile. Through force analysis, after discretization, the relationship between power and position is numerically simulated. In addition, the limitation of anaerobic work ability to decision-making is added. In order to facilitate the calculation, the two-dimensional situation is considered first, and then the three-dimensional situation of the turning is corrected separately. For different regions and courses, after determining the local environmental parameters according to the data, the optimization goal is to take the shortest time after spline interpolation. Anaerobic working capacity and maximum power are the constraints. The optimal numerical solution is carried out by using Method of Moving Asymptotes. The 2020 Olympic Games and the 2021 UCI World Championship are simulated, and the power-position curves are obtained.
